Data Integration: Combining COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data for comprehensive analysis.
Rolling Sum Calculations: Implementing window functions to calculate rolling sums of new vaccinations by location and date.
Percentage Calculations: Computing vaccination percentages relative to population size for insightful metrics.
Database Views: Creating SQL views for efficient data retrieval and visualization preparation.
The insights derived from this analysis can be used for various visualizations and further exploration of the pandemic's trends and effects.
